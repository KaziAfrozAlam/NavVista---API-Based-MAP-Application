# Project Title: NavVista
# Platform: Quantum X Hackathon
# Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Cloud APIs

I developed an interactive travel planning application called NavVista, aimed at simplifying travel itineraries and enhancing user experiences. The application leverages Google Cloud APIs to offer features such as:

Place Search: Users can easily search for popular destinations and attractions, making trip planning more efficient.
Dynamic Maps: Interactive maps provide visual context for users, allowing them to explore locations seamlessly.
Route Directions: Users can find optimal routes between destinations, ensuring a smooth travel experience.
This project showcases my ability to integrate various technologies and APIs to create user-centric applications.

# Scope
This project will test live traffic data through multiple platforms (API) for potential inclusion in VZ Viewer as a simple tool to check the live traffic.  Other uses comprise traffic volume at different hours of the day, months, year, and other non-arbitrary time frames. 
# Scenario
The user can see the live condition of the traffic, search for places, and draw routes to check the underlying traffic conditions and toggle the route (hide/show).

# Hierarchy of documents
The number of files shows the process of completion. Smaller numbers preceded newer versions, and larger numbers were built on the previous versions. In the event of having contributors, traditional versioning will be applied.

# API Key
The currently implemented API key is my personal API key from my Google developer account. We may need to get an organization API Key in the event of a potential inclusion.

# index.html
index page will be populated with the last version of the numbered files. Therefore the index and the last number must be identical.

# Other APIs

There are multiple other APIs that I would like to test including: 

TomTom Traffic API: TomTom offers a Traffic API that provides real-time and historical traffic information. It includes data on traffic flow, incidents, and road conditions. The API covers a wide range of countries and can be integrated into applications for traffic-aware routing, travel time estimation, and more.

HERE Traffic API: HERE offers a comprehensive set of APIs, including the Traffic API, which provides real-time traffic flow, incidents, and congestion data. It covers a broad geographic area and can be used for traffic-based routing, traffic visualization, and other applications.

MapQuest Traffic API: MapQuest provides a Traffic API that offers access to real-time traffic data, including incidents, traffic flow, and congestion information. The API allows developers to incorporate traffic data into their applications for route planning, traffic-aware navigation, and more.

Bing Maps Traffic API: Microsoft Bing Maps offers a Traffic API that provides real-time traffic data, including incidents, traffic flow, and road conditions. The API allows developers to retrieve traffic information for specific areas or routes and integrate it into their applications.

OpenRouteService: Openrouteserviceâ€™s directions can be used all around the globe. Consume rich route instructions in your applications for cars, trucks, different bike profiles, walking, hiking or wheelchair. Make use of plenty of options, ranging from different kinds of road restrictions to vehicle dimensions.
